    OOP Concepts Used:
    1. Encapsulation → Attributes like _name are protected.
    2. Polymorphism → Same function `info()` behaves differently in subclasses.
    3. Method Overriding → ExtendedModel overrides info() method.
    4. Multiple Inheritance → MultiModel inherits from ExtendedModel & LoggingMixin.
    5. Decorators → model_decorator adds extra behavior before/after function calls.
